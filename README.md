### <ins> plank2 </ins>

plank2 is a complete rewite of the older [plank.py](https://github.com/HemanthHaridas/plank.py) project written in Python and Cython.
The aim of the project is to use compiler optimizations and (or) optimized routines to reduce the computational time required to evaluate various integrals. The code is designed to have minimum dependancies on external or third-party libraries.

### <ins> usage </ins>

plank2 expects to find the input file generated by a python code that is distributed along with the executable (source). If you are generating the input file by hand, please note that the code expects the input file to be named *input.tmp*.
